        After a while the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come
        between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still they were
        unchallenged, and still Th√©oden gave no signal.... A smell of burning
        was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But
        the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas
        Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish, or by dread. He seemed to
        shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great weight of
        horror and doubt had settled on him.... They were too late! Too late was
        worse than never!....
